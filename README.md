# Bootstrap for Eprints  

A Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) theme for EPrints. 

## Description

This is a basic bootstrap eprints theme with as few design decisions as possible. It is supposed to be a blank canvas for you to build on. It uses some JQuery to remove and change existing eprints classes, to bootstrap classes. This allows the bootstrap CSS (which is called in the template) to style the side.

## Releases 

### 1.0.0 Beta

Very close to feature complete. Report any issues on Github issue tracker: https://github.com/eprintsug/bootstrap/issues

Issues will be fixed in future releases.

## Branding

The theme should work with any Bootstrap theme. The headers can be updated and changed by replacing the corresponding phrases. At the moment this is done by copying and updating lang/en/phrases/bootstrap.xml

This might change in future releases (possibly to js templating).
