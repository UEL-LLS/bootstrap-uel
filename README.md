Bootstrap for EPrints
=========

A Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) theme for EPrints. 


This is a basic bootstrap eprints theme with as few design decisions as possible. It is supposed to be a blank cavas for you to build on. It uses some JQuery to remove and change exisiting eprints classes, to bootstrap classes. This allows the bootstrap CSS (which is called in the template) to style the side.
